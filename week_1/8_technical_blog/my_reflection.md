Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I enjoyed the challenge of designing something new. I enjoyed the process of building pages of a website that all linked to each other; it was the first time during this phase that felt close to building a part of one cohesive unit--like I was constructing an organism that had depth and character. This was as close as we've gotten to interactivity thus far. I could click through a website, and I felt immense satisfaction in watching the page turn into another page that I had worked hard to code and design. I haven't gotten any comments/views yet, because the site just went live. I don't feel as confident about my design skills just yet. I have mostly been trying to imitate the design of blogs that I aesthetically admire.
