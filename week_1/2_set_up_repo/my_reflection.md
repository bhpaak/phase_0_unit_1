## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* CREATE/CLONE REPOSITORY
  Having logged into your GitHub account online, move your mouse pointer to the top-right corner of the page next to your username. Click on the plus (+) sign and select "New Repository". Name your repository, set as public, and select the appropriate license. When satisfied with your selections/descriptions, click "Create Repository" and celebrate!

* ON OPEN SOURCE...
  Open source is type of software project released into the public domain under the agreement that its source code is publicy accessible and the program can be redistributed in its original or modified form at some or no cost. This is different from free software. Open source is held to looser criteria than free software; both have official definitions, but the distinction between them is hard to delineate. So far, I have found and concluded (hopefully, not incorrectly) that the open source software can be redistributed with its original source code and patch files, but not as a modified version of its source code. This could present a limitation of user freedoms that are protected under the ideas of the free software movement. Having said this, I'm not sure how this particular difference could confer a signficant technical advantage or disadvantage, aside from execution speed. I'm not sure where I stand on this debate between open source and free software, but, as an aspiring developer, I am concerned with getting credit that is appropriate to my contribution to a project. This is where licenses come in.

* IMPORTANCE OF LICENSE
  Usage of licenses ensures that the original user is credited as the author of the software and outlines the rights of every user with regards to distribution, modification, and access/usage. In short, licenses allow the author to have control over what happens to their product, giving creative control over its future. 

* SOLIDIFIED CONCEPTS / STRUGGLES / RESOURCE LIST
  I learned that open source software is more than just access to source code. The big 'aha' moment was the revelation of two schools of thought within the free software community. I am still struggling with bringing to light just exactly what the differences are. I see it written over and over that the open source movement emphasizes the practicality of the open source development model, as opposed to the socioethical dilemma posed by the free software movement; the information I have found is too vague for me to understand. 
  I also realized that software is distributed with a license that outlines the details of how it is to be used, modified (or not), and distributed (or not). Whenever I used any kind of software, I would blindly click through the installation progress until I saw the progress bar. The 'License Agreement' was of no interest, and it never occurred to me that I was entering into an agreement with the distributor of the license that would bind me to conditions regarding the handling of the software.
