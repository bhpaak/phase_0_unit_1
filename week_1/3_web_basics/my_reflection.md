## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* 2 NEW THINGS
	I did not know the exact process by which networked computers translate IP addresses from website addresses. I did not know that name and root name servers were involved in ferrying information regarding pieces of the domain name to each other until the exact IP address is resolved and then sent back to the original computer that made the request. I lost the simple assumption that the Internet and the World Wide Web were one and the same. I learned that the Internet was the result of networked computers and was more than just web pages; it was the sharing of information of any kind. The World Wide Web was hyperlinked pages of information. 

* IMPORTANT THINGS to remember 
	Setting up an HTML site requires you to purchase a domain name from a registrar like Go Daddy or Namecheap. Then find a place to host your web site. Keep in mind that the place you host your website provides you with the IP address, while purchasing a domain name gives you the license to associate the IP address for your website to the domain name on a name server. 

* THE FEELS
	I was more confused than anything else. How does bhpaak.github.io render the index.html file in the repository? 

* 'AHA' MOMENTS
	There weren't any 'aha' moments this time around.
