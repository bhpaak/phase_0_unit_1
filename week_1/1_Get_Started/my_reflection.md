## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?


  Git and GitHub were already installed on my computer months before Phase 0 began. I didn't learn much during the process except for the fact that programs are made of libraries of code. 
  git is the program that allows for "version control". Simply put, version control allows the user to track changes being made to any piece of work and revisit past versions of the file. GitHub is the global answer to git's local solution. GitHub allows hosting of repositories on the Internet, so that they may be accessed from any machine. Local respositories can be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub and be made accessible to anybody. Git, in conjunction with GitHub, allows developers, who are working together to build software, to edit code simultaneously and maintain different versions of the code without interfering with each others work. When each developer is satisfied with their modifications and has committed these changes, they can push their respective branches to the original repository on GitHub. Creating separate branches of modifications and then merging these changes into one final draft is the function of version control and GitHub together.
  It's easy to see the benefit of version control to developers. But how does work happen in the community of GitHub? If one user provides the starting code to a personal project on GitHub and other developers join in, add code, and push their work to the original repository, does the original user have sole administrative access to merging or rejecting this new code? Progress could be bottlenecked if the merging of branches is left up to the discretion of just one user.
