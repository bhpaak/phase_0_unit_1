I had trouble with positioning during this challenge; the section on positioning from the Ruby track on Code Academy was very brief and skipped over potentially complex situations for the beginner. I figured out that "relative positioning" positions the div or target block relative to the its original place in the flow of the document. "Absolute positioning" takes the block element out of its original flow and positions itself relative to the browser window or the first parent element that is "relatively positioned".

I also learned that floated elements do not expand the containing parent element. I discovered this when I floated the primary and secondary (primary bar and sidebar, respectively) bars. I added another div, containing a single period, at the bottom with "hidden" visibilty and had it clear floated elements on "both" sides. This way I could separate the footer element from the bottom of the "main" div element, using margin-top. Before the margin attribute of the footer element would have begun measuring from the bottom of the header element where the "main" div element failed to expand. 

I am partially confident. My only concern is that there is always more than one way to do something. I am confident that I can always figure out how to at least construct a hack that gets the job done, but I am always looking for a better way to do the job. 

I enjoyed the parts with positioning and deciding on a color scheme. There's something about the positioning that breathes a bit of life into the content. It's like a messy room; when everything is cluttered and disorganized, it is hard to sift through it all and find a pair of clean pants. But when everything is neatly organized, suddenly your mind is clear, and you're imbued with new purpose. Choosing a color scheme is something that I usually am terrible at, but the white/black and Rockwell lettering for the title seemed to mesh perfectly. I may have celebrated. It's minimalistic, which I like, but it does seem bladn when you look at it for too long. Some more pictures may help with this, or a different color scheme altogether.

I didn't really find any part of this challenge tedious. Every detail helped make the website come alive, and each refresh and visible change on the page was satisfying. My favorite part, surprisingly, was the menu bar. I enjoyed making the hyperlink spread out across the containing rectangle and not limited to just the text.
