Hey guys,

Whoo.. I've finally caught up to you guys. Kelly and I worked out a later deadline for Week 1 due to some commitments that I had to wrap up. Better late than never!

Name: Brian Paak
Location: Los Angeles, CA for a UCLA education (but.. a San Jose, CA native)
Favorite Websites: Quora, Reddit, Facebook
Learning Style: multimodal; I learn best when I can sit down and read a book first, so that I can visualize the concepts myself and then supplement that with the provided visuals to compare and contrast my logic/thought process with what is accepted as true. The difference between these two visuals generates my questions and confusion. 

I look forward to meeting everybody through peer pairing in the coming weeks. 

Feel free to text/call me at 408.891.0246 if you want to get in touch with me to organize sessions. 

Happy coding,
Brian

**Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
