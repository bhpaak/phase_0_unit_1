* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

HTML makes sense in that there is a separation between structure and presentation, and HTML occupies the structural sphere of the World Wide Web. Accessibility is made easier through the use of structurally tied semantics, and my assumption is that search engine indexes are aided by the distinction made between results found within <h1> elements versus results found within <p> elements. The bad thing that I recognize is that functionality is spread across different languages. HTML and CSS are recognized by the rendering browser engine, but what if the engine was built to recognize just one language, and this language syntax had the capacity to add both structure and presentation to the document. This might make it easier to learn, albeit HTML and CSS are rather easy to pick up.
